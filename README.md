# Dialogflow_PHP_API
Developed during my on the job training at Lexmeet. It is a PHP API for Google's Dialogflow CX.

The *DialogflowAPI.php* file contains the Dialog Flow API. You can just copy it to your website and use its functions. 

The *dialogflowWenhook.php* is an example of how to use the API.
